    "- First, emergency medical care centers. These care centers will likely be interested in the results because of the insight they may provide for the day to day operations of the centers. We may discover that certain types of patients are much more likely to be readmitted to an emergency medical care center. This information could be used by the care centers to provide extra attention to the most at-risk patients once identified. In this case, the model would likely be deployed so that the healthcare professionals can have feedback as soon as possible. Throughout this project, we will focus on this possibility so as not to split our time and energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second, special focus groups, such as the [American Diabetes Association](http://www.diabetes.org/). These organizations can use the insight gained from our studies to issue standards or suggestions. These standards or suggestions could then be implemented at individual care centers. Since the ADA is a large organization with a relative large sphere of influence, these suggestions could help ensure parity accross a variety of care centers. In this case, the model would mostly be used for offline analysis. For this project, we will not focus on this possibility."
