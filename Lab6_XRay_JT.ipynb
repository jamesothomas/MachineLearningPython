    "> Select a dataset identically to lab two (images). That is, the dataset must be image data. In terms of generalization performance, it is helpful to have a large dataset of identically sized images. It is fine to perform binary classification or multi-class classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we chose to use a [random sample of NIH Chest X-Ray Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/sample/home). This dataset contains 5606 images that have been preprocessed to be a uniform size of $1024 \\times 1024$ and also includes a csv containing the labels associated with the x-ray images. This dataset includes X Ray images of patients with 14 different diseases."

    "Before we define the metric and decide on a test-train split, we need to make sure all of the X-Ray images are the same format. The images are all the same size, but we will need to make sure all of them are black and white as well as flipping some of the images along the vertical axis to account for the different persepctives used (patient laying on back or front). While we are doing this we will also resize the images to a smaller size to make our testing run quicker. If we use left-right flipping as a part of our data expansion, the initial flipping will be unnecessary. However, we wanted to start from a common initial point to (hopefully) get a better of idea how the individual variables affect our model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also taken the 2D Fourier transformation of the images and saved the transformations as numpy arrays as well as an image of the transforms. We may augment our model with the transformed space in order to see if there is any increase in performance with the additional \"momentum\" space information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will also need to do some work on the target to make it into a binary classification problem. Initially we will only try to classify the instances based on whether the patient had pnemonia or not. In the future we can also look at a binary classification of whether the patient had any disease or not. Finally, we can also try to a multi-classification model to predict each of the diseases individually. However, given that we only have ~5,000 images (before expansion), we do not think this model would perform very well."

Although a more in-depth metric, such as a custom cost matrix, may allow for finer tuning of the performace of our model, it removes the ability for us to compare our model with others.  \n",

Since Keras automatically manages the separation of the validation and training, we will manually split the 20% for testing from the remaining 80%. Furthermore, we will only split the pneumonia target for now."
